# Language Support

aockit supports languages other than JavaScript and TypeScript, by running your solution in the specified runner command from your template. Powered by [@parcel/watcher](https://npmjs.com/package/@parcel/watcher), it will watch your solution files and run your `runner` command whenever they change.

See [templates](/kit/templates) for more information.

In the future, a more robust runtime will be implemented to support other jobs concurrently like, linting, checks, benchmarks, etc.
